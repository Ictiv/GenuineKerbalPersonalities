//The bellow OS names and personalities are the default settings that will be used if the player chooses to use them at launch setup.
//If the OS name is set to "SKGKP" (Sirius Kybernetics Genuine Kerbal Personalities) then the "Default" name will be one associated with the personality chosen before hand by the player.
//"Booted" refers to whether or not the part will need to be booted.
//If "False" is given, the player will be given the option to choose name/personality.
//If "True" is given, the player will NOT be prompted to give those choices, and instead the ship will automatically be set to the settings bellow.
//PS or "ProcessorSlowness" much like Kerbals' "Stupidity" meter is a reversed stat, but more than that, it indicates the default time the given computer needs to say something new automatically. It is calculated in seconds.
